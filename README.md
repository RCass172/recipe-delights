# **Introduction**

Recipe Delights is a community based recipe collection containing recipes for special occasions, such as afternoon tea and dinner parties. Users have the option of browsing all the recipes when not logged in, however registering an account will allow the user to add, edit and delete recipes also. Inspiration for this website came from my love of food and wanting a unique website to showcase recipes for those more special events.

## **Design**

* Hero Image - The table setting used for the hero image was chosen to relate to the website and colors matched in with the overall theme.
* Colors - I wanted to use rich colors to give an elegant feeling to match the overall theme. Using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color palette generater i was able to find the below set which i was happy with.

* Fonts - I used the Dancing Script and fallback font of cursive to add a sense of style and elegance to the website by using on the hero image text and welcoming message on user profile. I then paired the Lato and Montserrat fonts throughout the website which both match well together with a fallback font of sans-serif. These were integrated into the website using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Logo - The website logo was created on the website [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org/) which is used on the navigation bar.
